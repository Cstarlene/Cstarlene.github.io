<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-relationship-between-media-and-body-image">The Relationship between Media and Body Image</h3>
<p>Studies on the effects of viewing photos of thin actresses and models have been conducted for years. It was determined that watching tv can cause body dissatisfaction (Eisend and Möller, 2007), including commercials of thin women which were found to cause an increase of eating disorder symptomatology and body dissatisfaction (Grabe et al., 2008). In fact, multiple studies have found that viewing images of thin models has detrimental effects on women’s body satisfaction (Groesz et al., 2001; Moreno-Domínquez et al., 2019; Rounds and Stutts, 2021). However, body satisfaction improves when the models being depicted are plus sized (Moreno-Domínquez et al., 2019; Groesz et al., 2001) or average sized (Groesz et al., 2001).</p>
<p>Moreno-Domínquez et al.&nbsp;(2019) had participants fill out the Body Satisfaction Questionnaire, which assesses how much time the participant thinks about their body shape and size, prior to being called and asked to be part of a fashion marketing experiment. Each group was shown a slideshow consisting of images of models, and asked to compare their own bodies with those of the models. This study showed one group images of thin models–those with a BMI below 19–and another group images of overweight models–those with a BMI of over 26. After viewing the slideshow, participants once again took the Body Satisfaction Questionnaire which allowed the researchers to compare what body-image concerns were constant, and what seemed to be influenced by the stimuli presented.</p>
<p>Groesz et al.&nbsp;(2001) meta-analysis looked at articles studying the relationship between media and body satisfaction. The inclusion criteria were that the studies sampled females; stimuli showed the entire body of thin models; studies that had control groups that were shown images of average models, overweight models, attractive nonmodels, or objects; and measurement of body dissatisfaction or physical attractiveness. Overall, their analysis showed that viewing images of thin models lowered body satisfaction more than viewing images of average models, objects or overweight models. Also, samples that had more body issues were affected more negatively than samples with lower body image issues, and those under 19 years old were affected more negatively than those 19 and older.</p>
<p>Rounds and Stutts (2021) had female college students complete questionnaires on body satisfaction, disordered eating attitudes and behaviors, and visual analog scales on state body satisfaction and negative mood. One group viewed images of all fitspiration images, another all travel images, and the third group viewed half fitspiration and half travel images. The fitspiration images came from the #fitspiration page on Instagram and showed images of women in the gym or posing while wearing workout clothing. These women were either toned or thin. The travel images were from the #travel page and had no people depicted. To ensure that participants were paying attention to the images, they were asked to explain each photo in a sentence. Their findings revealed that not only did the fitspiration group have lower body satisfaction and a more negative mood than the other groups, but that even the group that viewed both fitspiration and travel images had lower body satisfaction and more negative mood than the control group.</p>
<p>Another study found that young girls and college women who viewed photos of sexualized athletes made more comments focused on attractiveness and appearance, commented more positively on the athlete’s body, and made more objectifying and negative comments about their own bodies (Daniels, 2012). The participants who viewed images of athletes that depicted them playing their sport made comments focusing on the athlete and their own physical skills and made more comments about physical activity and sports than appearance (Daniels, 2012). The rise of social media has led to more recent studies that focus on how the presence of these apps in our everyday lives impacts the body image of users. They have found that restrained eating with associated with posting selfies online (Niu et al., 2020), and that using social networking sites was correlated with internalization of societal beauty standards, high body consciousness, and dieting (Tiggemann &amp; Slater, 2013). Societal beauty standards set the expectation that women will be thin and have attractive features, and put pressure to conform to this image (Jung and Lennon, 2003). There is also a correlation between the use of these sites and loneliness (Pop et al., 2022). A study also found that self-esteem was lower in participants who viewed a photo that allowed for upward comparison, while photos that caused downward comparison did not cause as much change in self-esteem (Vogel et al., 2014). The researchers describe upward comparison as comparing oneself to someone or something that is viewed as superior, whereas downward comparison is comparing oneself to someone or something that is thought of as inferior (Vogel et al., 2014). This conclusion on upward comparison is supported by another study that found that exposure to images of thin women working out lowered body satisfaction and increased negative moods, even when shown alongside images that did not depict any people (Rounds and Stutts, 2021).</p>
<p>Factors that Increase Vulnerability</p>
<p>These studies have also found that some girls and women are especially vulnerable to the harmful impacts of using social media. In fact, Aubrey (2006) found that sexually objectifying media only impacts women that are easily influenced by media exposure, and that the negative impact is caused by comparing oneself to these images. Other studies have found that comparison is more likely when the image that is being viewed reflects the ideal body type of the participant (Clayton et al., 2017; Aubrey, 2006) and that higher levels of comparison are related to having more depressive symptomatology (Sinclair &amp; Jordan, 2022). Clayton et al.&nbsp;(2017) found that the decrease in body satisfaction was related to the participants’ disappointment with themselves at not having achieved their body goals. This accounted for the decrease in effect as the models grew larger, because the participants were no longer viewing the image the image as a body that they could, but failed to achieve (Clayton et al., 2017).</p>
<p>Pre-existing body concerns and identification with beauty standards also increase vulnerability to negative impacts caused by the media. Niu et al.&nbsp;(2020) found that self-objectification causes negative emotions, increases body evaluations, and increases the pursuit of sexiness and attractiveness. Women who accepted societal beauty standards that encourage women to look a certain way to be considered attractive were more likely to be affected by the media because it reinforced these standards (Grabe et al., 2008). Women who accept the standards place more importance on appearance, which is related to having poor body image, low self-esteem, and negative mood (Jung &amp; Lennon, 2003). Niu et al.’s (2020) finding that selfie-posting led to restrained eating was not caused necessarily by the selfies, but as an attempt to improve their bodies because of their increased focus on appearance and the self-objectification that occurred as a result of posting images of themselves online. Women who already had poor body satisfaction were also affected by media (Grabe et al., 2008; Groesz et al., 2001). Moreno-Domínquez et al.&nbsp;(2019) found that images of thin models especially harmed women that already struggled with poor body image, and Aubrey (2006) found that women with low self-esteem were particularly affected by sexually objectifying media, this was defined in their study as television and magazines portrayed sexual desirability as being derived mainly from a woman’s appearance and body.</p>
<p>**The Present Study ** The above literature suggests that the use of social media, particularly media that portrays thin women as the ideal beauty (Moreno-Domínquez et al., 2019; Niu et al., 2020; Groesz et al., 2001; Rounds and Stutts, 2021; Eisend and Möller, 2007) or media that is sexually objectifying (Aubrey, 2006; Daniels, 2012), has an effect on a person’s perception of themselves. It causes them to internalize their belief that they do meet these standards, which can result in harmful behaviors like restrained eating as they attempt to lose weight and become more sexually attractive (Niu et al., 2020; Tiggemann &amp; Slater, 2013) and lead to over negative feelings about themselves such as low self-esteem, loneliness, depressive symptomatology, and body dissatisfaction (Sinclair &amp; Jordan, 2022; Clayton et al., 2017; Rounds and Stutts, 2021; Pop et al., 2022; Grabe et al., 2008). Every social media platform has an algorithm that recommends posts to a user based on their likes and dislikes in order to provide content that will keep the consumer on their platform for longer. This algorithm means that many users get caught mindlessly scrolling to find posts that they enjoy, while not recognizing the impact that these posts are having on them.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between social media and self-perception. We hypothesize that women’s self-perception will be negatively impacted by the social media posts from the #fitspo page, and that the women in this group will have higher PASTAS scores after viewing the images, indicating more anxiety about their appearance. We also believe that women’s self-perception will be positively impacted in the #bodypostivity group, and that the women in this group will have lower PASTAS scores which would indicate less anxiety about their appearance.</p>
