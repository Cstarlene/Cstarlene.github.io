<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<p><strong>Participants</strong></p>
<p>Sixty-six female undergraduate students were recruited from Fresno Pacific's campus and classrooms. The only excluded demographics were males, graduate students, or students not currently enrolled at FPU. Recruiting was done by asking students in classes, the Forest, and other areas of campus if they were willing to participate in a study about social media and body image. Before recruitment began, a proposal for this was submitted to and approved by the Institutional Review Board. The IRB number for this experiment is 2023.049.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our participants ranged from eighteen to twenty-four years of age, and the average age was 20. Of our participants, 65.15% identified themselves as Latino or Hispanic, around a quarter as Caucasian (24.24%), and 10.61% as Asian. 6.06% marked "other" as their ethnicity, and less than 2% marked "Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander" and "prefer not to say" (1.52% each). An equal number of participants were single as were in a relationship (48.48%), and less than 2 percent were married, or did not respond (1.52% each). Of our participants, only one respondent did not indicate that they were heterosexual/straight, instead declining to answer. 90.91% of our participants marked that they were Catholic/Christian, 6.06% were not religious, and 3.03% indicated that they were another religion. Participants also indicated religiosity level, with 45.45% marking moderate and 25.76% marking slightly. 19.7% indicated that they were very religious, 6.06% were not religious, and 3.03% did not know their religiosity level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants were also asked to report their average daily screen time and what apps they used. 31.82% of the women had a screen time between three and four hours, and around a quarter indicated that their average time was between one to two hours (25.76%). 24.24% were on their phones for an average of five to six hours a week. Finally, 13.64% were on their phones for more than seven hours, and 4.55% reported their screen time as averaging less than an hour a day. The most frequently used social media app used was Instagram (71.21%, followed by TikTok (68.18%). About a quarter of respondents used YouTube (25.76%), 19.70% used another form of social media, and only 7.58% reported using Twitter.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Measures</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Social Media Usage and Comparison</em></strong></p>
<p>In this study, we observed the effects that social media has on body image. Each group viewed Instagram content from a different hashtag. Instagram was chosen as the social media application of choice because the wide variety of content means that comparison could easily be induced. The photos that were taken from the two appearance-based hashtags–#fitspo and #bodypositivity–all show the majority of a woman's body, in workout attire and workout settings, but with different body types. The women from #fitspo were thin and toned, while the women from #bodypositivity page were average to plus-sized. The photos from #travel do not have any people in the photos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three hashtags being used were #fitspo, #bodypositivity, and #travel. The effect of viewing images from the #travel page and the #fitspiration page has previously been studied (Rounds &amp; Stutts, 2021). The criteria used to select photos for our study, did so based on the criteria used by Rounds and Stutts (2021). In their study, photos were taken from the #fitspiration page that depicted women in workout clothes, posing and working out, and who were thin or toned because that was the most common content on the hashtag (Rounds &amp; Stutts, 2021). We used this exact criterion to select the photos from the #fitspo page, and changed the body type we were selecting to average or plus-sized when we were selecting photos from the #bodypositivity page because of studies that found a positive effect on participants who viewed images of women with these body-types (Moreno-Domínquez et al., 2019; Groesz et al., 2001). Just like Rounds and Stutts (2021), the photos from the #travel page were photos that had no people included.</p>
<p>To ensure they are comparing themselves to the women in the photos, participants are asked after every photo to fill out a prompt. In all groups, the participants will be asked "what is something you notice about the photo", similar to the prompts used by Daniels (2012).</p>
<p><strong><em>Body Image and Self-Perception</em></strong></p>
<p>Body image is defined as a person's perceptions, feelings and thoughts about his or her body, and is usually conceptualized as incorporating body size estimation, evaluation of body attractiveness and emotions associated with body shape and size (Grogan, 2006). Self-perception and body image will be used interchangeably. The effects of body image was measured by the scores from the combined questionnaire of the Physical Appearance State and Trait Anxiety Scale-State Version (Reed et al., 1991) and the Body Esteem Scale Revised (Frost et al., 2017). The questionnaire consisted of questions that allowed the participant&nbsp; to rate how anxious, tense, or nervous they felt about aspects of their appearance ("The extent to which I look overweight") with a Likert scale from 0 to 4 (0=Not at all, 4=Exceptionally so).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>
<p>After the participant was recruited and agreed to participate in our study, they were randomly assigned to one of the three groups. Then the participant was contacted through email with the corresponding survey from the group they were assigned. The survey consisted of 4 different sections. The first section was where the participant will consented to completing the survey and participating in our study. The next section contained the photos chosen from Instagram from the corresponding hashtag for that group. The selected hashtags from Instagram are #fitspo, #bodypositivity, #travel. The fitspiration images depict thin and toned women in workout clothing, the body positivity images depict average and plus-sized women in workout clothing, and the travel images depict landscapes with no people in the shot. They were exposed to five different photos from the selected hashtag and after viewing each photo they were prompted to answer the question "What's something you notice in this photo?" After viewing all of the photos, they then were asked to fill out a questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of from the combined questionnaire of the Physical Appearance State and Trait Anxiety Scale-State Version (Reed et al., 1991) and the Body Esteem Scale Revised (Frost et al., 2017). The questionnaire consisted of questions that allowed the participant to rate how anxious, tense, or nervous they felt about aspects of their appearance ("The extent to which I look overweight") with a Likert scale from 0 to 4 (0=Not at all, 4=Exceptionally so). The third section consisted of questions that relate to their social media usage. The last section of the survey was the demographics of the participant and a few questions about their social media usage.&nbsp;</p>
