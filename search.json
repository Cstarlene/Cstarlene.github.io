We also believe that women’s self-perception will be positively impacted in the #bodypostivity group, and that the women in this group will have lower PASTAS scores which would indicate less anxiety about their appearance. Female undergraduate students were recruited from around Fresno Pacific University’s main campus, and asked to view five photos from one of three hashtags prior to completing the Physical Appearance State and Trait Anxiety Scale. We found that the photos had no significant effect on the women’s body image. The limitations of this study, and possible reasons for the insignificant results are discussed."

    "text": "The Relationship between Media and Body Image\nStudies on the effects of viewing photos of thin actresses and models have been conducted for years. It was determined that watching tv can cause body dissatisfaction (Eisend and Möller, 2007), including commercials of thin women which were found to cause an increase of eating disorder symptomatology and body dissatisfaction (Grabe et al., 2008). In fact, multiple studies have found that viewing images of thin models has detrimental effects on women’s body satisfaction (Groesz et al., 2001; Moreno-Domínquez et al., 2019; Rounds and Stutts, 2021). However, body satisfaction improves when the models being depicted are plus sized (Moreno-Domínquez et al., 2019; Groesz et al., 2001) or average sized (Groesz et al., 2001).\nMoreno-Domínquez et al. (2019) had participants fill out the Body Satisfaction Questionnaire, which assesses how much time the participant thinks about their body shape and size, prior to being called and asked to be part of a fashion marketing experiment. Each group was shown a slideshow consisting of images of models, and asked to compare their own bodies with those of the models. This study showed one group images of thin models–those with a BMI below 19–and another group images of overweight models–those with a BMI of over 26. After viewing the slideshow, participants once again took the Body Satisfaction Questionnaire which allowed the researchers to compare what body-image concerns were constant, and what seemed to be influenced by the stimuli presented.\nGroesz et al. (2001) meta-analysis looked at articles studying the relationship between media and body satisfaction. The inclusion criteria were that the studies sampled females; stimuli showed the entire body of thin models; studies that had control groups that were shown images of average models, overweight models, attractive nonmodels, or objects; and measurement of body dissatisfaction or physical attractiveness. Overall, their analysis showed that viewing images of thin models lowered body satisfaction more than viewing images of average models, objects or overweight models. Also, samples that had more body issues were affected more negatively than samples with lower body image issues, and those under 19 years old were affected more negatively than those 19 and older.\nRounds and Stutts (2021) had female college students complete questionnaires on body satisfaction, disordered eating attitudes and behaviors, and visual analog scales on state body satisfaction and negative mood. One group viewed images of all fitspiration images, another all travel images, and the third group viewed half fitspiration and half travel images. The fitspiration images came from the #fitspiration page on Instagram and showed images of women in the gym or posing while wearing workout clothing. These women were either toned or thin. The travel images were from the #travel page and had no people depicted. To ensure that participants were paying attention to the images, they were asked to explain each photo in a sentence. Their findings revealed that not only did the fitspiration group have lower body satisfaction and a more negative mood than the other groups, but that even the group that viewed both fitspiration and travel images had lower body satisfaction and more negative mood than the control group.\nAnother study found that young girls and college women who viewed photos of sexualized athletes made more comments focused on attractiveness and appearance, commented more positively on the athlete’s body, and made more objectifying and negative comments about their own bodies (Daniels, 2012). The participants who viewed images of athletes that depicted them playing their sport made comments focusing on the athlete and their own physical skills and made more comments about physical activity and sports than appearance (Daniels, 2012). The rise of social media has led to more recent studies that focus on how the presence of these apps in our everyday lives impacts the body image of users. They have found that restrained eating with associated with posting selfies online (Niu et al., 2020), and that using social networking sites was correlated with internalization of societal beauty standards, high body consciousness, and dieting (Tiggemann & Slater, 2013). Societal beauty standards set the expectation that women will be thin and have attractive features, and put pressure to conform to this image (Jung and Lennon, 2003). There is also a correlation between the use of these sites and loneliness (Pop et al., 2022). A study also found that self-esteem was lower in participants who viewed a photo that allowed for upward comparison, while photos that caused downward comparison did not cause as much change in self-esteem (Vogel et al., 2014). The researchers describe upward comparison as comparing oneself to someone or something that is viewed as superior, whereas downward comparison is comparing oneself to someone or something that is thought of as inferior (Vogel et al., 2014). This conclusion on upward comparison is supported by another study that found that exposure to images of thin women working out lowered body satisfaction and increased negative moods, even when shown alongside images that did not depict any people (Rounds and Stutts, 2021).\nFactors that Increase Vulnerability\nThese studies have also found that some girls and women are especially vulnerable to the harmful impacts of using social media. In fact, Aubrey (2006) found that sexually objectifying media only impacts women that are easily influenced by media exposure, and that the negative impact is caused by comparing oneself to these images. Other studies have found that comparison is more likely when the image that is being viewed reflects the ideal body type of the participant (Clayton et al., 2017; Aubrey, 2006) and that higher levels of comparison are related to having more depressive symptomatology (Sinclair & Jordan, 2022). Clayton et al. (2017) found that the decrease in body satisfaction was related to the participants’ disappointment with themselves at not having achieved their body goals. This accounted for the decrease in effect as the models grew larger, because the participants were no longer viewing the image the image as a body that they could, but failed to achieve (Clayton et al., 2017).\nPre-existing body concerns and identification with beauty standards also increase vulnerability to negative impacts caused by the media. Niu et al. (2020) found that self-objectification causes negative emotions, increases body evaluations, and increases the pursuit of sexiness and attractiveness. Women who accepted societal beauty standards that encourage women to look a certain way to be considered attractive were more likely to be affected by the media because it reinforced these standards (Grabe et al., 2008). Women who accept the standards place more importance on appearance, which is related to having poor body image, low self-esteem, and negative mood (Jung & Lennon, 2003). Niu et al.’s (2020) finding that selfie-posting led to restrained eating was not caused necessarily by the selfies, but as an attempt to improve their bodies because of their increased focus on appearance and the self-objectification that occurred as a result of posting images of themselves online. Women who already had poor body satisfaction were also affected by media (Grabe et al., 2008; Groesz et al., 2001). Moreno-Domínquez et al. (2019) found that images of thin models especially harmed women that already struggled with poor body image, and Aubrey (2006) found that women with low self-esteem were particularly affected by sexually objectifying media, this was defined in their study as television and magazines portrayed sexual desirability as being derived mainly from a woman’s appearance and body.\n**The Present Study ** The above literature suggests that the use of social media, particularly media that portrays thin women as the ideal beauty (Moreno-Domínquez et al., 2019; Niu et al., 2020; Groesz et al., 2001; Rounds and Stutts, 2021; Eisend and Möller, 2007) or media that is sexually objectifying (Aubrey, 2006; Daniels, 2012), has an effect on a person’s perception of themselves. It causes them to internalize their belief that they do meet these standards, which can result in harmful behaviors like restrained eating as they attempt to lose weight and become more sexually attractive (Niu et al., 2020; Tiggemann & Slater, 2013) and lead to over negative feelings about themselves such as low self-esteem, loneliness, depressive symptomatology, and body dissatisfaction (Sinclair & Jordan, 2022; Clayton et al., 2017; Rounds and Stutts, 2021; Pop et al., 2022; Grabe et al., 2008). Every social media platform has an algorithm that recommends posts to a user based on their likes and dislikes in order to provide content that will keep the consumer on their platform for longer. This algorithm means that many users get caught mindlessly scrolling to find posts that they enjoy, while not recognizing the impact that these posts are having on them.\nThe purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between social media and self-perception. We hypothesize that women’s self-perception will be negatively impacted by the social media posts from the #fitspo page, and that the women in this group will have higher PASTAS scores after viewing the images, indicating more anxiety about their appearance. We also believe that women’s self-perception will be positively impacted in the #bodypostivity group, and that the women in this group will have lower PASTAS scores which would indicate less anxiety about their appearance."

    "text": "Methods\nParticipants\nSixty-six female undergraduate students were recruited from Fresno Pacific's campus and classrooms. The only excluded demographics were males, graduate students, or students not currently enrolled at FPU. Recruiting was done by asking students in classes, the Forest, and other areas of campus if they were willing to participate in a study about social media and body image. Before recruitment began, a proposal for this was submitted to and approved by the Institutional Review Board. The IRB number for this experiment is 2023.049. \nOur participants ranged from eighteen to twenty-four years of age, and the average age was 20. Of our participants, 65.15% identified themselves as Latino or Hispanic, around a quarter as Caucasian (24.24%), and 10.61% as Asian. 6.06% marked \"other\" as their ethnicity, and less than 2% marked \"Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander\" and \"prefer not to say\" (1.52% each). An equal number of participants were single as were in a relationship (48.48%), and less than 2 percent were married, or did not respond (1.52% each). Of our participants, only one respondent did not indicate that they were heterosexual/straight, instead declining to answer. 90.91% of our participants marked that they were Catholic/Christian, 6.06% were not religious, and 3.03% indicated that they were another religion. Participants also indicated religiosity level, with 45.45% marking moderate and 25.76% marking slightly. 19.7% indicated that they were very religious, 6.06% were not religious, and 3.03% did not know their religiosity level. \nParticipants were also asked to report their average daily screen time and what apps they used. 31.82% of the women had a screen time between three and four hours, and around a quarter indicated that their average time was between one to two hours (25.76%). 24.24% were on their phones for an average of five to six hours a week. Finally, 13.64% were on their phones for more than seven hours, and 4.55% reported their screen time as averaging less than an hour a day. The most frequently used social media app used was Instagram (71.21%, followed by TikTok (68.18%). About a quarter of respondents used YouTube (25.76%), 19.70% used another form of social media, and only 7.58% reported using Twitter. \nMeasures\nSocial Media Usage and Comparison\nIn this study, we observed the effects that social media has on body image. Each group viewed Instagram content from a different hashtag. Instagram was chosen as the social media application of choice because the wide variety of content means that comparison could easily be induced. The photos that were taken from the two appearance-based hashtags–#fitspo and #bodypositivity–all show the majority of a woman's body, in workout attire and workout settings, but with different body types. The women from #fitspo were thin and toned, while the women from #bodypositivity page were average to plus-sized. The photos from #travel do not have any people in the photos. \nThe three hashtags being used were #fitspo, #bodypositivity, and #travel. The effect of viewing images from the #travel page and the #fitspiration page has previously been studied (Rounds & Stutts, 2021). The criteria used to select photos for our study, did so based on the criteria used by Rounds and Stutts (2021). In their study, photos were taken from the #fitspiration page that depicted women in workout clothes, posing and working out, and who were thin or toned because that was the most common content on the hashtag (Rounds & Stutts, 2021). We used this exact criterion to select the photos from the #fitspo page, and changed the body type we were selecting to average or plus-sized when we were selecting photos from the #bodypositivity page because of studies that found a positive effect on participants who viewed images of women with these body-types (Moreno-Domínquez et al., 2019; Groesz et al., 2001). Just like Rounds and Stutts (2021), the photos from the #travel page were photos that had no people included.\nTo ensure they are comparing themselves to the women in the photos, participants are asked after every photo to fill out a prompt. In all groups, the participants will be asked \"what is something you notice about the photo\", similar to the prompts used by Daniels (2012).\nBody Image and Self-Perception\nBody image is defined as a person's perceptions, feelings and thoughts about his or her body, and is usually conceptualized as incorporating body size estimation, evaluation of body attractiveness and emotions associated with body shape and size (Grogan, 2006). Self-perception and body image will be used interchangeably. The effects of body image was measured by the scores from the combined questionnaire of the Physical Appearance State and Trait Anxiety Scale-State Version (Reed et al., 1991) and the Body Esteem Scale Revised (Frost et al., 2017). The questionnaire consisted of questions that allowed the participant  to rate how anxious, tense, or nervous they felt about aspects of their appearance (\"The extent to which I look overweight\") with a Likert scale from 0 to 4 (0=Not at all, 4=Exceptionally so). \nProcedure\nAfter the participant was recruited and agreed to participate in our study, they were randomly assigned to one of the three groups. Then the participant was contacted through email with the corresponding survey from the group they were assigned. The survey consisted of 4 different sections. The first section was where the participant will consented to completing the survey and participating in our study. The next section contained the photos chosen from Instagram from the corresponding hashtag for that group. The selected hashtags from Instagram are #fitspo, #bodypositivity, #travel. The fitspiration images depict thin and toned women in workout clothing, the body positivity images depict average and plus-sized women in workout clothing, and the travel images depict landscapes with no people in the shot. They were exposed to five different photos from the selected hashtag and after viewing each photo they were prompted to answer the question \"What's something you notice in this photo?\" After viewing all of the photos, they then were asked to fill out a questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of from the combined questionnaire of the Physical Appearance State and Trait Anxiety Scale-State Version (Reed et al., 1991) and the Body Esteem Scale Revised (Frost et al., 2017). The questionnaire consisted of questions that allowed the participant to rate how anxious, tense, or nervous they felt about aspects of their appearance (\"The extent to which I look overweight\") with a Likert scale from 0 to 4 (0=Not at all, 4=Exceptionally so). The third section consisted of questions that relate to their social media usage. The last section of the survey was the demographics of the participant and a few questions about their social media usage."

    "text": "Discussion\nWe found that there was no significant difference in the body image scores across the groups, this means that we are unable to conclude that the photos from the different Instagram hashtags had an effect on the body image of our participants. This differs from previous studies which have found that viewing images of thin women negatively impacts a woman's body satisfaction (Groesz et al., 2001; Moreno-Domínguez et al., 2019; Rounds and Stutts, 2021), while viewing images of plus-sized or average-sized women positively impacted a woman's body satisfaction (Moreno-Domínguez et al., 2019' Groesz et al., 2001). It also goes against Rounds and Stutts's (2021) finding that viewing photos to the #fitspiration page on Instagram negatively impacted body satisfaction of the women participating, which were photos that also images of thin or toned women in workout clothing just as the images that we selected from our study were.\nOur findings do support Groesz et al.'s (2001) finding that the body satisfaction of girls under the age of 19 was more impacted by viewing images of thin women than that of women who are 19-years-old or older. More research should be done to determine why age seems to play a role. Future studies could look into the role of media literacy, and how our understandings of the ability of social media users to edit their images before posting may increase as we get older. Additionally, future research could investigate if our overexposure to social media and the beauty standard—which is suspected by researchers to be the cause of the negative body satisfaction reported after viewing images of thin women (Moreno-Domínguez et al., 2019; Niu et al., 2020; Groesz et al., 2001; Rounds and Stutts, 2021; Eisend and Möller, 2007)—may reduce the impact that it has.\nIt is also possible that recruiting students from a Christian university impacted our results. A past study found that having strong religious beliefs and a solid relationship with God was correlated with less body image concerns, while a \"superficial faith coupled with a doubtful and anxious relationship with God\" was correlated with higher levels of body image concern (Akrawi et al., 2015, p. 7). 90.9% of our participants identified as Catholic or Christian, and around 65% rated themselves as ranging from moderately to very religious. Future research could compare the scores across a variety of college campuses, to compare if being in a religious setting impacts body image.\nFinally, it is also noted that our travel group had the highest PASTAS scores of the three conditions. While this difference was insignificant, it is possible that these photos may have elicited thoughts about travel that increased body concerns. Future research could look into whether viewing landscape images leads to thoughts of how self-conscious a person feels on an airplane, walking around unfamiliar areas, or how they feel in clothing that may be the expected attire for the location (e.g., a bikini at the beach).\nLimitations and Future Directions\n         Our experiment had some limitations. Our sample size was relatively small, which resulted in a high standard deviation between the Physical Appearance State and Trait Anxiety Scale scores. A higher sample size would have been preferable, and may have reduced the standard deviation or changed the means of the scores.\n         As noted above, future research could investigate if the impact on body image caused by social media is reduced with age because we become desensitized, the effect of media literacy on the impact of social media to our body image, the role of religion, and the impact of landscape images. Studies could further investigate the role of age by comparing the results of different age groups to each other to see how the impact of social media on body image may change as we age. In addition, it may also be beneficial to have participants complete the PASTAS test before and after viewing the photos in order to see what may have been a direct influence of the photos they were exposed to.\nConclusion\nThis study tested the effect of images from three different Instagram hashtags on women's perception of their body. Our results indicated that there was no significant influence of the posts on the women's feelings about their body. We suspect that this finding may be because of our mean age, small sample size, or the religious nature of the university. Further research should be conducted to determine the influence of these factors."
